# Stack:

A stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same end represented as the top of the stack.

## Basic Operations:

- push() adds an element into the stack
- pop() removes an element from the stack
- peek() returns (but does not remove) the element of top of the stack.
- isEmpty() returns true if stack is empty, else false.
- size() returns the size of stack.
