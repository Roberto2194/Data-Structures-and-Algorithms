# Queue

A <b>Linked List</b> is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

## Basic Operations:

- **addNode()** will add node to the list. 
- **display()** will show all the nodes present in the list.

A typical node in a linked list consists of two fields:

- **data** represents the data value stored in the node.
- **next** represents a pointer that points to next node in the list.

and in the case of a doubly linked list:
- **previous** represents a pointer that points to the previous node.
